# Vote Tournament

Basically we're gonna use this web app to come up with a band name.

Let's say our potential band names are the following:

1. Third Space
2. Rum Punches
3. Mythical Island
4. Magical Journey
5. Common Area
6. The Martians
7. The Mumblos
8. Fruitless Pursuit
9. Genetic Apex: Charizard

Then we first vote on Third Space vs Rum Punches, next we vote on Mythical Island vs Magical Journey, eventually the winner of Third Space vs Rum Punches will go against the winner of Mythical Island vs Magical Journyey, etc.
